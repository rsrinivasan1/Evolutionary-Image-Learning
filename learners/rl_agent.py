    """Wander in some direction and learn from successes & failures

    NOTE: this is a non-sparse reward setting, since our actions of placing pixels
    have immediate rewards/penalties
    - near-continuous action space

    State: self.canvas
    Output: action, described as (x, y, size, color)

    Notes on policy gradient methods:
    - Value function: estimate of discounted rewards in future
        - allows agent to learn what states are advantageous
        - might learn to "setup" for next placement
        - input: state, output: estimated discounted reward
    - Advantage estimate (A): discounted reward - value function
        - measure of whether action was better than expected
    - Objective: E[Ï€(a | s) * A]

    - TRPO takes vanilla policy gradient and makes sure that policy doesn't stray too far away
      from previous value -- removes the chance of overly aggressive updates

    Notes on PPO:
    - Main objective: E[min(r(theta) * A, clip(r(theta), 1 - epsilon, 1 + epsilon) * A]
        - clipping makes sure we don't change prob(action) too much:
            - if it's already good, and action is more likely now, don't increase
              prob(action) too much on a single estimate
            - if it's already good, and action is less likely now, make it more likely
            - if it's bad, and action is less likely now, don't decrease prob(action)
              too much because it could just be noise
            - if it's bad, and action is more likely now, undo this by making
              action less likely -- reflected in objective

    - Q. Is T = 1 in this case since we don't need to run our policy for multiple timesteps
         in order to get a reward?
    - A. I think not necessarily, since running the same policy for multiple timesteps will
         always give us a more comprehensive overview of what the policy is doing

    - Actors - entities executing the same policy in the environment for T timesteps
    - Discounted rewards = weighted sum of rewards accumulated after trying the current policy
      for each of t timesteps, for t < T
    - Value function = neural network
        - input: current state of canvas
        - output: estimate of discounted reward (compare with true value to train)
        - objective: sum over all actors over all timesteps of (actual reward - value function output)^2
